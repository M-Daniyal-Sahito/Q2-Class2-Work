// 🚀 Excited to Share My Progress in Next.js! 🚀

// I’ve just completed my Class 2 Assignment in Next.js, where I built a website template that includes a fully functional navbar, content area, and footer. 🎉

// This project helped me dive deeper into component-based architecture, and I’m really enjoying learning how to structure web applications efficiently. Looking forward to building more with Next.js!

// Feel free to check out my journey, and let's connect! 💻👨‍💻
